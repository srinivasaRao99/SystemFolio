#SystemFolio

Welcome to SystemFolio, a unique portfolio showcasing my projects and skills through the nostalgic lens of vintage operating systems. This repository features an interactive experience inspired by the design elements of classic OS interfaces, merging functionality with retro aesthetics. 

Explore various sections, including my projects, education, and contact information, all presented in a playful and engaging manner. Each part of the portfolio mimics the feel of an old-school desktop environment, complete with icons and windows that evoke a sense of nostalgia while providing a modern touch.

Join me on this journey through my work as I blend creativity and technology in a way that pays homage to the computing history that inspires me.
